        <h2 id="r1">KADUVA</h2>
        <P> PLOT:Kaduva is also the story of the misuse of official machinery to settle personal scores, and the fact that some of it happened in real life makes it even more shocking. Jinu V. Abraham's script does not attempt to spring any surprises, rather it banks fully on the strength of the mass scenes, of which there are some.

        <h2 id="r1">VAASHI</h2>
         <P> PLOT:The movie is successful in portraying our justice system which may appear to be fair and objective, but has a very subjective and personal level of interference at least subconsciously. Overall, Vaashi is an engaging courtroom drama, with Tovino Thomas and Keerthy Suresh playing their roles convincingly.
